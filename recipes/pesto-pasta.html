    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>8 ounces penne pasta, preferably with ridges</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup parmesan cheese, plus more for serving if you like</li>
        <li>¼ cup sun dried tomatoes, drained if packed in oil</li>
        <li>½ cup basil pesto, homemade or quality store-bought, plus more if you like</li>
        <li>½ to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Handful of torn basil leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken. Add the chicken to a bowl and season with the Italian seasoning and a big pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt it well with about 1 tablespoon of salt. Drop the pasta in the boiling water and cook until al dente according to package instructions (about 8 to 9 minutes).</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken. While the pasta is cooking, add the olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and heat over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden brown on the outside and cooked through, about 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta. When the pasta is ready, reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water and drain.</li>
        <li>Combine. To the pan with the chicken, lower the heat and stir in the cooked pasta, heavy cream, parmesan, and sundried tomatoes. Stir until everything is well combined. If it looks a bit dry, add a splash of the pasta cooking water (a couple tablespoons at a time) until the pasta is glossy and coated in the creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the pesto. Turn off the heat and take the pan off the burner. Stir in the basil pesto and finish with a sprinkle of grated parmesan, red pepper flakes, and basil leaves. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
